#summary This is how SimpleJPA will name items in SimpleDB
#labels Phase-Support,Manual

= Domain =

The domain will be named with the following scheme: 

{{{
factory.getPersistenceUnitName() + "-" + className;
}}}

The PersistenceUnitName is what is passed in when constructing the EntityManagerFactory.

{{{
className = object.getClass().getSimpleName()
}}}

This will use the root class name if it is an inheritance hierarchy.

= Fields/Attributes =

These will be named the same as the field itself unless you use @Column(name = "somethingElse").

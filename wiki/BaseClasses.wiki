#summary Some common base classes

= Introduction =

There are a couple classes you can extend to get some common functionality.

IdableBase and IdableTimestampedBase. IdableBase has an id field with appropriate annotations and IdableTimestampedBase extends IdableBase and adds created and updated Date fields that will automatically get set/updated when inserted or updated.

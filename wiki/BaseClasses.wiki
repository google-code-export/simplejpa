#summary Some common base classes

= Introduction =

There are a couple classes you can extend to get some common functionality.

IdedBase and IdedTimestampedBase. IdedBase has an id field with appropriate annotations and IdedTimestampedBase extends IdedBase and adds created and updated Date fields that will automatically get set/updated when inserted or updated.

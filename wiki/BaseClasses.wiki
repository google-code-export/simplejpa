#summary Some common base classes

= Introduction =

There are a couple classes you can extend to get some common functionality.

  * IdedBase - has an id field @Id annotation
  * [http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&q=show:Cd2TNPgmc_s:d2FrQKvJBGg:Cd2TNPgmc_s&sa=N&ct=rd&cs_p=http://simplejpa.googlecode.com/svn&cs_f=trunk/core/src/com/spaceprogram/simplejpa/model/IdedTimestampedBase.java IdedTimestampedBase] - extends IdedBase and adds created and updated Date fields that will automatically get set/updated when inserted or updated.

So you can easily make a ready to go entity just by extending one of these objects.

{{{
public class Book extends IdedTimestampedBase {
   private String title;
   
   public void getTitle(){
      return title;
   }
   public void setTitle(String title){
      this.title = title;
   }
}
}}}

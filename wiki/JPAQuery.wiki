#summary All about querying with SimpleJPA

= Introduction =

SimpleJPA queries are a subset of the JPA spec due to the limitations of SimpleDB. Keep in mind that many things can be accomplished by doing things in a different way.

= Limitations =

  * Can only query on a single object type, no joins. 
  * Can only filter the query on properties of the object type specified in FROM. Cannot filter on properties referenced objects.

= Examples =

{{{
 query = entityManager.createQuery("select o from MyTestObject o where o.income = :income and o.age = :age");
        query.setParameter("income", 50507.0);
        query.setParameter("age", 12);
        List<MyTestObject> obs = query.getResultList();
}}}

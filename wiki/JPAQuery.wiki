#summary All about querying with SimpleJPA

= Introduction =

SimpleJPA queries are a subset of the JPA spec due to the limitations of SimpleDB. Keep in mind that many things can be accomplished by doing things in a different way.

= Supported =

  * =
  * <
  * >
  * <=
  * >=
  * <> (not equal)
  * AND 
  * OR
  * IS NULL
  * IS NOT NULL

= Limitations =

  * Can only query on a single object type, no joins. 

= Examples =

{{{
query = entityManager.createQuery("select o from MyTestObject o where o.income = :income and o.age = :age");
query.setParameter("income", 50507.0);
query.setParameter("age", 12);
List<MyTestObject> obs = query.getResultList();
}}}

Can also query down object graph (1 level only right now):

{{{
query = entityManager.createQuery("select o from MyTestObject o where o.someOtherObject.name = :name");
query.setParameter("name", "finnigan");
List<MyTestObject> obs = query.getResultList();
}}}

But keep in mind, querying down the graph can be slow because it will query for the id's down the graph, then apply them to the top level query.

    CacheManager Configuration
    ==========================
    An ehcache.xml corresponds to a single CacheManager.

    See instructions below or the ehcache schema (ehcache.xsd) on how to configure.

    DiskStore configuration
    =======================

    Sets the path to the directory where cache files are created.

    If the path is a Java System Property it is replaced by its value in the
    running VM.

    The following properties are translated:
    * user.home - User's home directory
    * user.dir - User's current working directory
    * java.io.tmpdir - Default temp file path

    Subdirectories can be specified below the property e.g. java.io.tmpdir/one
    -->
    <diskStore path="java.io.tmpdir"/>

    <!--
    Cache configuration
    ===================

    The following attributes are required.

    name:
    Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.

    maxElementsInMemory:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory

	maxElementsOnDisk:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
	The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    overflowToDisk:
    Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the memory store
    has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes and elements are optional.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    diskPersistent:
    Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
    The default value is false.

    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds:
    The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
    is 120 seconds.

    diskSpoolBufferSizeMB:
    This is the size to allocate the DiskStore for a spool buffer. Writes are made
    to this area and then asynchronously written to disk. The default size is 30MB.
    Each spool buffer is used only by its cache. If you get OutOfMemory errors consider
    lowering this value. To improve DiskStore performance consider increasing it. Trace level
    logging in the DiskStore will show if put back ups are occurring.

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)

    Cache elements can also contain sub elements which take the same format of a factory class
    and properties. Defined sub-elements are:

    * cacheEventListenerFactory - Enables registration of listeners for cache events, such as
      put, remove, update, and expire.

    * bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a BootstrapCacheLoader, which is called by a
      cache on initialisation to prepopulate itself.

    * cacheExtensionFactory - Specifies a CacheExtension, a generic mechansim to tie a class
      which holds a reference to a cache to the cache lifecycle.

    * cacheExceptionHandlerFactory - Specifies a CacheExceptionHandler, which is called when
      cache exceptions occur.

    * cacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a CacheLoader, which can be used both asynchronously and
      synchronously to load objects into a cache.

    RMI Cache Replication

    Each cache that will be distributed needs to set a cache event listener which replicates
    messages to the other CacheManager peers. For the built-in RMI implementation this is done
    by adding a cacheEventListenerFactory element of type RMICacheReplicatorFactory to each
    distributed cache's configuration as per the following example:

    <cacheEventListenerFactory class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMICacheReplicatorFactory"
         properties="replicateAsynchronously=true,
         replicatePuts=true,
         replicateUpdates=true,
         replicateUpdatesViaCopy=true,
         replicateRemovals=true
         asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=<number of milliseconds"
         propertySeparator="," />

    The RMICacheReplicatorFactory recognises the following properties:

    * replicatePuts=true|false - whether new elements placed in a cache are
      replicated to others. Defaults to true.

    * replicateUpdates=true|false - whether new elements which override an
      element already existing with the same key are replicated. Defaults to true.

    * replicateRemovals=true - whether element removals are replicated. Defaults to true.

    * replicateAsynchronously=true | false - whether replications are
      asynchronous (true) or synchronous (false). Defaults to true.

    * replicateUpdatesViaCopy=true | false - whether the new elements are
      copied to other caches (true), or whether a remove message is sent. Defaults to true.

    * asynchronousReplicationIntervalMillis=<number of milliseconds> - The asynchronous
      replicator runs at a set interval of milliseconds. The default is 1000. The minimum
      is 10. This property is only applicable if replicateAsynchronously=true


    Cluster Bootstrapping

    The RMIBootstrapCacheLoader bootstraps caches in clusters where RMICacheReplicators are
    used. It is configured as per the following example:

    <bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory
        class="net.sf.ehcache.distribution.RMIBootstrapCacheLoaderFactory"
        properties="bootstrapAsynchronously=true, maximumChunkSizeBytes=5000000"
        propertySeparator="," />

    The RMIBootstrapCacheLoaderFactory recognises the following optional properties:

    * bootstrapAsynchronously=true|false - whether the bootstrap happens in the background
      after the cache has started. If false, bootstrapping must complete before the cache is
      made available. The default value is true.

    * maximumChunkSizeBytes=<integer> - Caches can potentially be very large, larger than the
      memory limits of the VM. This property allows the bootstraper to fetched elements in
      chunks. The default chunk size is 5000000 (5MB).


    Cache Exception Handling

    By default, most cache operations will propagate a runtime CacheException on failure. An
    interceptor, using a dynamic proxy, may be configured so that a CacheExceptionHandler can
    be configured to intercept Exceptions. Errors are not intercepted.

    It is configured as per the following example:

      <cacheExceptionHandlerFactory class="com.example.ExampleExceptionHandlerFactory"
                                      properties="logLevel=FINE"/>

    Caches with ExceptionHandling configured are not of type Cache, but are of type Ehcache only,
    and are not available using CacheManager.getCache(), but using CacheManager.getEhcache().


    Cache Loader

    A default CacheLoader may be set which loads objects into the cache through asynchronous and
    synchronous methods on Cache. This is different to the bootstrap cache loader, which is used
    only in distributed caching.

    It is configured as per the following example:

        <cacheLoaderFactory class="com.example.ExampleCacheLoaderFactory"
                                      properties="type=int,startCounter=10"/>

    Cache Extension

    CacheExtensions are a general purpose mechanism to allow generic extensions to a Cache.
    CacheExtensions are tied into the Cache lifecycle.

    CacheExtensions are created using the CacheExtensionFactory which has a
    <code>createCacheCacheExtension()</code> method which takes as a parameter a
    Cache and properties. It can thus call back into any public method on Cache, including, of
    course, the load methods.

    Extensions are added as per the following example:

         <cacheExtensionFactory class="com.example.FileWatchingCacheRefresherExtensionFactory"
                             properties="refreshIntervalMillis=18000, loaderTimeout=3000,
                                         flushPeriod=whatever, someOtherProperty=someValue ..."/>
